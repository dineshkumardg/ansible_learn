terraform and ansible can be used for infrastructure as a code. Yes you can
deploy a VM and setup its features like disk, RAM virtual network etc from the
UI. but when you have to do that for multiple VMS it becomes tedius

Terraform and Ansible

So, why do we need both Terraform and Ansible? Well, they each serve a
different purpose and complement each other. Terraform is designed to
provision different infrastructure components. Ansible is a
configuration-management and application-deployment tool. It means that you’ll
use Terraform first to create, for example, a virtual machine and then use
Ansible to install necessary applications on that machine. But by default,
these two are separate tools. In order to make them work together, you need to
integrate Terraform-managed nodes with Ansible control nodes. Let’s see how to
do that.
